This study presents CO isotopologues observations of region ( $$147.5^{\circ} \leq l \leq159.5^{\circ}$$ and $$0^{\circ}\leq b \leq8^{\circ}$$ ) in total of 96 deg$^2$ toward Camelopardalis direction. By decomposing velocity structures, we obtained 99 hierarchical molecular clouds in this direction and made catalogue of 52 MCs whose distances can be estimated within the 99 MCs . The total mass of the 52 MCs obtained is 43569 $$M_{\odot}$$ by X factor in $$^{12}$$CO and 26772 $$M_{\odot}$$ by LTE assumption in $$^{13}$$CO. The distance resolved MCs can be divided into 2 layers, the Front Layer(FY) in [150, 350]pc and Back Layer(BY) in [650, 850]pc. A clump finding algorithm was used to identify dense clumps. There are 678 clumps in the FY and 1017 clumps in the BY. Catalogues are made to present properties of these clumps. The virial parameters of two layers is similar at about 0.34, while the velocity dispersion varies quite differently. In the FY, a Bow like structure is found, by comparing positions with the Local Bubble, this Bow like structure do located on the shell of the Local Bubble, the evolutionary age of the Bow like MC is estimated about XXX years. In the BY, there is a Crescent structure which is likely the shell of a superbubble formed by shock wave from Supernovae and stellar wind from massive stars. To form such a shell, at least III energy is needed which can be offered by massive stars, therefore the Crescent structure can be formed by massive stars.
