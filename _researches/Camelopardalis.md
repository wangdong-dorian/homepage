This study presents CO isotopologue observations of a region spanning $$147.5^{\circ} \leq l \leq 159.5^{\circ}$$ and $$0^{\circ} \leq b \leq 8^{\circ}$$, totaling 96 deg$$^2$$ in the direction of Camelopardalis. By decomposing velocity structures, we identified 99 hierarchical molecular clouds and measured the distances of 40, revealing two primary zones: the foreground Bow and the background Shell. Clump searches within this region identified 3,128 clumps, with 2,022 having determined distances; the majority are gravitationally bound, with a median virial parameter of 0.78. Specifically, 613 clumps are in the Bow and 682 in the Shell, with the Shell's clumps being more gravitationally bound, indicated by a smaller virial parameter. The total mass of the region is estimated at 25,269 solar masses, with the Shell contributing significantly more mass than the Bow, which contains 2,467 solar masses. PV diagrams suggest the Shell has an expansion velocity of 7.5 km/s. Assuming the Shell's center is the progenitor of a supernova remnant (SNR), we estimate a radius of 55 pc, corresponding to a total kinetic energy of $$9.1 \times 10^{48}$$ ergs and an expansion timescale of 7.2 Myr. Bow molecular clouds, located on the surface of the Local Bubble, are at an early stage of star formation, as indicated by spectral line wings and young stellar objects (YSOs). Their velocity structures and morphology suggest that the MCs in the Bow may have originated from the fragmentation of a single massive molecular cloud.


In addition to the primary findings, my exploration of this region has revealed numerous other intriguing structures, such as a filamentary structure in the northwest part of the Bow, small cavities within both the Bow and Shell molecular clouds, and outflow sources in both regions. However, due to time and scope constraints, these features are not further elaborated in the present work.
