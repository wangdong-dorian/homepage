I am a master's student at the School of Astronomy and Space Science, University of Science and Technology of China, which is associated with the Purple Mountain Observatory, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

My research in astronomy currently focuses on the fundamental properties of molecular clouds in the Milky Way, the relationship between the formation of molecular clouds and stellar feedback, and the characteristics of molecular clouds located on the surface of the Local Bubble.

And my [CV](../files/Dorian_Resumes.pdf)

Also, I am a big fan of motorsports, especially in F1 racing. Haha
